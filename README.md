## DESCRIPTION
The group’s topic of interest was to analyze data collected from the employees which possibly can be a measurement for employees’ performance, involvement, and satisfaction with the current position and answer a question, whether or not that employee left.
The group used a simulated dataset from kaggle.com: [“Human Resources Analytics. Why are our best and most experienced employees leaving prematurely?”](https://www.kaggle.com/ludobenistant/hr-analytics)
